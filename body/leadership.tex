Handling vacancies in the offices of President or VP is straightforward:
\begin{enumerate}
      \item If the office of President is vacant, the duly-elected VP becomes the
            President.
      \item If the office of VP is vacant, the duly-elected President may appoint a VP with
            consent of Council.
      \item If the offices of both the President and VP are vacant, the senior-most
            duly-elected officer acts as President in the interim and call a by-election
            for all vacant roles within 15 days.
\end{enumerate}
If any other office is vacant, the President must within 15 days call a by-election according to~\ref{sec:elections}. In the meantime, the President by choose to appoint an interim officer (who is also eligible for by-election).

\begin{enumerate}
      \item If the by-election's nomination period passes and the interim officer for some
            office is the only nominee, they become duly-elected to that office by
            acclamation.
      \item If some office is without eligible nominees when the nomination period ends or
            is otherwise left vacant after a by-election, the President may appoint a new
            officer (considered duly-elected) with consent the Council. The President may
            choose to leave the office vacant until the next general election.
\end{enumerate}
